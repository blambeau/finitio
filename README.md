# Finitio - A Data Language

*Finitio* is a data language. For now, it is limited to a data definition
language (DDL). Think "JSON/XML schema", but a slightly different way, that
puts the emphasis on precision. *Finitio* comes with a dedicated type system for defining data and a theory, called *information contracts*, for interoperability with programming and data exchange languages.
