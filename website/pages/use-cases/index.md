*Finitio* can be used in many places where data is involved. In particular, it
can be used for:

* *Enforcing* data types towards more robust and secure (RESTful)
  web-services, configuration files, data exchanges, etc.
* *Validating* data input, e.g. screens and HTML forms.
* *Coercing* low-level to high-level types when digesting data, to palliate
  the fact that exchange languages have limited type systems (e.g. JSON has no
  builtin time type) and raise the level of abstraction in a safe and almost
  transparent way.
* *Documenting* data types and schemas, in RESTful resource definitions, NoSQL
  document databases, etc.
* *Mapping* data types in heterogeneous environments, towards a better and
  simpler interoperability between databases, various programming languages,
  data exchange languages, etc.

Have a look at the concrete use-cases listed in the menu at right to better
understand how *Finitio* is used in practice. We hope to enrich this
collection of concrete examples in the near future, so feel free to contribute
your use-case if you use Finitio.
