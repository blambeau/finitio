<p><em>Finitio</em> can be used in many places where data is involved. In particular, it
can be used for:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Enforcing</em> data types towards more robust and secure (RESTful)
web-services, configuration files, data exchanges, etc.</li>
<li>
<em>Validating</em> data input, e.g. screens and HTML forms.</li>
<li>
<em>Coercing</em> low-level to high-level types when digesting data, to palliate
the fact that exchange languages have limited type systems (e.g. JSON has no
builtin time type) and raise the level of abstraction in a safe and almost
transparent way.</li>
<li>
<em>Documenting</em> data types and schemas, in RESTful resource definitions, NoSQL
document databases, etc.</li>
<li>
<em>Mapping</em> data types in heterogeneous environments, towards a better and
simpler interoperability between databases, various programming languages,
data exchange languages, etc.</li>
</ul><p>Have a look at the concrete use-cases listed in the menu at right to better
understand how <em>Finitio</em> is used in practice. We hope to enrich this
collection of concrete examples in the near future, so feel free to contribute
your use-case if you use Finitio.</p>
